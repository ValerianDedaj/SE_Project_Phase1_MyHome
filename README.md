# Project Details

## Project Title: [MyHome]

## Problem Statement:
[Our project idea is to create a web  available on mobile phones and
computers. The web is called ”My Home”, and we chose this to facilitate
people  lives. The reason why we came up with this idea is the lack of
such service in our country. We all have been faced with the daily
problems that our house has, them being either an electrical problem,
house cleaning issues, tap difficulties etc. But it is tiring and difficult to
find the right person at record time, and calling multiple numbers can be
confusing and time-consuming..]

## Solution Proposed:
[This app intends to be the intermediary
between us (clients) and companies or self-employed workers who have
their personalized profile with their information(phone number, payment
fee, hours available etc) that can help us with these issues.
