# Project Details

## Project Title: [MyHome]

## Problem Statement:
[Our project idea is to create a web  available on mobile phones and
computers. The web is called ”My Home”, and we chose this to facilitate
people  lives. The reason why we came up with this idea is the lack of
such service in our country. We all have been faced with the daily
problems that our house has, them being either an electrical problem,
house cleaning issues, tap difficulties etc. But it is tiring and difficult to
find the right person at record time, and calling multiple numbers can be
confusing and time-consuming..]

## Solution Proposed:
[This app intends to be the intermediary
between us (clients) and companies or self-employed workers who have
their personalized profile with their information(phone number, payment
fee, hours available etc) that can help us with these issues.

### 5. Application Specifications:

#### a. Architecture:
The application will be a web-based platform with a client-side interface for users, including freelancers and clients, and a server-side component for managing freelancer-related operations.

#### b. Database Model:

**Contractor Table:**
- **Attributes:**
  - `id`: Primary Key, unique identifier for each contractor.
  - `name`: Name of the contractor.
  - `price`: Price or rate of the contractor's service.
  - `email`: Email address of the contractor.
  - `phone`: Phone number of the contractor.
  - `service`: Type of service provided by the contractor.
  - `property type`: Type of property the contractor specializes in (e.g., residential, commercial).
  - `message`: Additional message or description provided by the contractor.

- **Constraints:**
  - **Primary Key Constraint:**
    - `id` column serves as the primary key (PK) for the contractors table, uniquely identifying each record.
  - **Not Null Constraint:**
    - Applied to columns `name`, `price`, `email`, `phone`, `service`, `property_type`, and `message` to ensure these fields must have values for each record.
  - **Auto-increment:**
    - `id` column is set to auto-increment so that each new record automatically gets a unique identifier without needing manual input.
  - **Data Type Constraints:**
    - Each column is assigned a specific data type suitable for the type of data it holds (e.g., VARCHAR for text, INT for integers).
  - **Unique Constraint (if applicable):**
    - No unique constraints are specified in our table.

#### Admin Interface:
The admin page allows the admin user to view a list of contractors stored in the database. The displayed information includes the contractor's ID, name, price, email, phone, service, property type, and message. The admin can edit or delete individual contractor records using the provided links. While the code interacts with a database to display information on the admin page, there isn't a separate database specifically for admin-related data. The "myhome_db" database is the main database containing information about contractors, which the admin can access and manage through this interface.


### c. Technologies Used:
